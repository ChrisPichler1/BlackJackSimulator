# BlackJackSimulator
This is a blackjack simulator I coded because I was bored one night and I wanted to see how many times the dealer wins vs the player. I did not account for splits or insurance because I literally did this in one night because I was bored. I may add to it later. Everything
was pretty straight forward except for aces which can equal 11 or 1 depending on what is most advantageous for the player. I randomized the order of 6 whole decks worth of cards into a Queue because I read that most casinos use 6-8 decks of cards at a time, and I felt
the most comfortable doing this simulation using a Queue for the deck instead of an ArrayList, although you could replace the Queue with random draws in the ArrayList to save some memory. I also have the program print to the console what happened in that hand to get an
idea of how each game ended. As I said above, I would like to incorporate splitting and insurance at some point, but I was just bored tonight and I wanted to see how it would work. I went to a website and read what the best play is depending on the face-up card of the 
dealer, as well as what the player's hand total is, so it is assumed in this simulation that the player is always making the best possible play (outside of splits and insurance).
